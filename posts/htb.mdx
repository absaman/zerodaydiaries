In July Deloitte held its Annual hackyholidays Capture the Flag (CTF) event. This yearâ€™s theme was to save the city from an evil AI. There were 32 challenges with multiple parts in each challenge. In total there were 81 individual tasks with various points.

This year CTF focused on a number of areas (Web, Forensics, Exploit, Reversing (Mobile, Linux, and Windows) Cloud, Quantum, and Steganography). As with my passion, I focused on Forensics and completed most tasks. I was also successful at some of the web exploitation challenges, All the training from tryhackme has paid off.

Below I will discuss the challenges completed in full and then I will go through the partially complete challenges.
